<h2> Description </h2>
<p align="justify">
  I am creating Kafka Streams - Real-time Stream Processing to help you understand the stream processing in general and apply that knowledge to Kafka Streams Programming. This course is based on my book on the same subject with the same title. My Book is already published and is available with all major online retailers as an eBook and Paperback. 
  My approach to creating this course is a progressive common-sense approach to teaching a complex subject. By using this unique approach, I will help you to apply your general ability to perceive, understand, and reason the concepts progressively that I am explaining in this course.

<h3>Who should take this Course?</h3>
<p align="justify">
Kafka Streams - Real-time Stream Processing course is designed for software engineers willing to develop a stream processing application using the Kafka Streams library. I am also creating this course for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organizationâ€™s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Kafka implementation, but they work with the people who implement Kafka Streams at the ground level.

<h3>Kafka Version used in the Course</h3>
<p align="justify">
This course is using the Kafka Streams library available in Apache Kafka 2.x. I have tested all the source code and examples used in this course on Apache Kafka 2.3 open source distribution. Some examples of this course also make use of the Confluent Community Version of Kafka. We will be using Confluent Community Version to explain and demonstrate functionalities that are only available in the Confluent Platform, such as Schema Registry and Avro Serdes.
